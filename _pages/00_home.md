Software and Systems for Reproducibility @ [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) 2021 Workshop will promote the work of researchers building the software and systems that empower reproducible science in machine learning. Researchers will present work that focuses on, but is not limited to:

- Scientific communication through software design
- Open evaluation and benchmark tasks, *especially those that challenge current evaluation practices*
- Open source libraries and tools
- Computational limits to reproducibility, such as lack of transparency, deprecation, environmental impact, privacy considerations, or financial cost
- The role of hardware and lower level software (OS, linear algebra libraries) on reproducibility


In conjunction with [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), the workshop will be held virtually.  We hope to hold regional meetups in line with public health guidelines.
